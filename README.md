# Mentorship Slackbot

## General overview

### Workflow
Slackbot appears for all hackers, click button to ask for help. Bot asks for question.

1. Mentees interact with the BOT through DM.

Welcome Message | Request Popup     
:-:|:--:
![Welcome Message](docs/welcome.png) | ![Request Popup](docs/dialog.png)

2. The bot posts the request into the private channel of mentors. It will tag mentors with the relevant skill.
![Mentor Request](docs/request.png)

4. Mentor can claim the request, at which point a DM is created between the mentor, the requester, and the bot

5. The Mentor will receive controls via DM to close the request if itâ€™s done, or surrender it back into the queue if they cannot do it

6. Bot pings a stats channel (e.g. #general) every 3 hours with updates and how to get in touch for help

7. Old, unclaimed requests are automatically bumped every 10 min if nobody has responded to it

### Skills
1. Mentors can set their skills with the bot through the `!skills` command in DM

### Errors
The bot will automatically report any runtime errors to the private mentors channel (tagging the mentor lead in the process!).

## Tech Setup

### Data Store
This app is written in TypeScript and uses a local `lowdb` json database to store sessions. This json database file is automatically generated at runtime as [src/storage/db.json](src/storage/db.json). 

### Configuration
Configuration parameters are stored in [src/config/index.ts](src/config/index.ts). A sample configuration file is provided in this repo.

## Deployment
**This bot is deployed manually with `skaffold run`. It will not autodeploy from master**
When deploying make sure to manually delete the old deployment, otherwise the new one will forever wait for the volume claim
