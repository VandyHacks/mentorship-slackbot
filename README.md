# Mentorship Slackbot

## General overview

Slackbot appears for all hackers, click button to ask for help. Bot asks for question.

1. DM the bot
2. The bot posts the request into the private channel of mentors
3. Mentors can use the thread of that post to message the requester 1:1, user can reply to the bot, which is then mirrored in the thread
4. Mentor can claim the request, at which point a DM is created between the mentor, the requester, and the bot
5. Mentor can then close the request if itâ€™s done, or reopen if they cannot do it
6. Bot pings #general every couple hours with updates and how to get in touch for help
7. Old, unclaimed requests are automatically bumped every 10 min if nobody has responded to it
